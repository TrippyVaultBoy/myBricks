* What is it your are going to build

    I am going to build a simple LEGO collection organizer. It will include routes to add, delete, update sets in a users collection. I will also include a login and authentication system to keep collections secure and tamper free. To reduce calls to the LEGO api that im getting set information from I will implement a cache of sets. A logger with keep record of all requests to the API as well as all unexpected errors.

    Tools I'll use:
    Documentation - Swagger.js
    API Framework - Express.js
    Database/Caching - MongoDB Atlas + mongoose
    Authentication - JSON Web Tokens
