## Project Description  

This project, **myBricks**, is an Express.js-based API designed to simplify LEGO collection management. myBricks API features secure user authentication with JWT, a MongoDB-powered collection database, and caching to reduce external API calls. Building this project strengthened my skills in backend development, authentication, and database management, while giving me experience creating a production-ready API from scratch.


## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** [Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, JSON Web Token]
- **Tools Used** [Swagger, Postman]


## The Story of Development  

This project started with a rough outline of requirements for our T4 final project.  
During development, I:  
- Designed the general idea of what I wanted myBricks to do: User creation and authentication with JWT, add and remove sets to a users collection as well a cache sets to prevent repetative calls to the rebrickable api.
- Implemented the minimum viable product as well as a few strech goals: API documentation with swagger, a logger for requests and errors, and live hosting through render.  


## Features Implemented  

- Account creation with Username, email and password
- Login with credentials given and are provided with a JWT token for authenticaion
- Standard CRUD operations for managing LEGO sets in a users collection
- Caching of calls to the rebrickable api
- API documentation with swagger
- Live hosting at mybricks.dev with render


## Features To Be Implemented  

- Basic Frontend for ease of use
- Collection filters and sorting


## Challenges Faced  

The hardest part of this project was:  
- Exporting the Postman collection JSON and conversion to swagger compatable YAML
